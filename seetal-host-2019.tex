\begin{abstract}
SAT-attack is known to decrypt a {\em functionally correct key} of an encrypted combinational circuit. 
Recently, sequential locking was proposed as a defense to SAT-attack on sequential circuits and subsequently ScanSAT was proposed as an unlocking mechanism for the same. 
ScanSAT method converts the sequential locking problem to an instance of logic locking problem, and thereby decrypts the entire sequential key using SAT-attack. 
In this paper, we show that ScanSAT does not guarantee decryption of {\em functionally correct key}, and a defense against ScanSAT.  
%in the presence of encrypted XOR-chains at combinational outputs. Additionally, we propose a low-overhead defense against ScanSAT, that exploits this property. 
The proposed defense had $95-100\%$ success rate when tested on sequentialized ISCAS'85 and MCNC benchmarks, across five different encryption schemes, and $1-3$ orders of magnitude increase in decryption time for large circuits. \\

%Firstly, we provide two different output paths for each observe flip-flop: an XOR/XNOR-type encrypted scan path and an unencrypted functional path. 
%Secondly, we perform XOR/XNOR-type encryption of timing-uncritical combinational outputs, such that they daisy-chain with the encrypted scan chains, to form encrypted XOR/XNOR-chains, making it impossible for the SAT solver to distinguish {\em functionally correct keys} amidst the large equivalence class of {\em scan-mode correct keys}. 
%We propose a new sequential locking scheme, where the flip-flop has an encrypted scan path and an unencrypted functional path, along with encryption key gates only at the combinational outputs. 
%In the presence of proposed sequential locking scheme, applying ScanSAT on $20$ benchmark circuits, across five different state-of-the-art logic-encryption schemes, revealed $95-100\%$ success in decrypting a {\em functionally incorrect key}. Additionally, since encryption is only at the boundary, it is area-efficient and functional output quality evaluation can be executed at RTL-level, making it very efficient and feasible for industry practice. 
%Additionally, the proposed technique incurs minimum timing and energy overheads on the chip's functional mode of operation.
