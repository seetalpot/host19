\begin{frame}{Akash feedback}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it necessary for a new work (DFT encryption etc.) in this direction, or is it possible to easily extend Prof. Mallik's work to sequential circuits ?
\item Is it possible to remove combinational logic-locking completely, and do only scan-locking ?
\item Is it possible to remove some key gates in combinational logic, and thereby add keys in scan, so that we can get away without any overhead ?
\item Will the encrypted-scan-cell, in spite of change in cell layout, fit within the standard cell row ?
\item Ensure work-related data is backed-up!
\end{itemize}
