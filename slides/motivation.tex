\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SAT-attack is able to succesfully decrypt combinational-logic-encryption keys\footnote{J. A. Roy et al, "EPIC: Ending Piracy of Integrated Circuits", DATE 2008} \footnote{P. Subramanyan et al, "Evaluating the Security of Logic Encryption Algorithms", HOST 2015.}
		\item Real-life digital circuits are sequential in nature, so some of the combinational inputs are driven by flip-flops
		\item Therefore, means of launching SAT-attack : DFT
