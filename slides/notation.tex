Define scan-unencrypted circuit $C(G,SC,CK)$ and scan-encrypted circuit $C^{'}(G,SC,CK,SK)$, where \\
$G = \{g_0, g_1, \ldots g_N\}$ is set of gates \\
$SC = \{sc_0, sc_1, \ldots sc_N\}$ is set of scan cells \\
$CK = \{ck_0, ck_1, \ldots ck_X\}$ is the combinational-logic-encryption key and \\
$SK = \{sk_0, sk_1, \ldots sk_Y\}$ is the scan-encryption key \\
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Notation}
	Define $C^{'}_U(G,CK,G_U)$ be the scan-unrolled circuit, where $G_U$ is the list of gates added to $C$ during unroll.
