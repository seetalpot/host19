\section{Problem Formulation}
\begin{frame}{Tradeoff}
\begin{itemize}
\item The higher the number of scan-cells that are encrypted, the better
%\item Replacing the NOT gate with XOR gate inside the scan-cell incurs area, timing and power overhead
\item The larger the size of the SAT instance, \alert{the harder to decrypt}
\item Encrypting the scan cell incurs \alert{slight area, timing and power overheads}
\item Routing scan-encryption-key bits incur \alert{slight area overhead}
\end{itemize}
