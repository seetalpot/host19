\section{Attack model}
\noindent The attack model used in this paper is same as the one used in~\cite{pramod:host15}. More specfically, we consider a malicious foundry, where the attacker 
has access to layout and mask information. Hence, the gate-level netlist can be reverse-engineering from this. We also assume that the attacker has access to an activated
IC on which to apply input patterns and observe outputs. This could be obtained by purchasing an activated IC from the open
market. The components of our attack model are therefore: (i) a gate-level netlist of the encrypted IC and (ii) a means for applying arbitrary input patterns and observing the resultant
outputs on an activated IC.
